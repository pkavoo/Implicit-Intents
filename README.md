# Implicit-Intents
Implicit intents specify the action which should be performed and optionally data which provides content for the action. If an implicit intent is sent to the Android system, it searches for all components which are registered for the specific action and the fitting data type.
The application demonstrates some implementations of implicit intents and run-time permissions.
